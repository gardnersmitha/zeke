# Zeke: Strategic Plan for AI-Age Homeowner Assistant

## Executive Summary

Zeke is an AI-powered homeowner assistant that combines the knowledge of a general AI with the context of YOUR specific home, connected to an ecosystem of products, professionals, and proactive maintenance. Unlike generic AI chatbots, Zeke knows your home, remembers your history, and can actually help you take action.

## The Value Proposition

### Why Not Just Use ChatGPT?

| Generic AI | Zeke |
|------------|------|
| Knows about homes in general | Knows about YOUR home specifically |
| Stateless - starts fresh every time | Remembers your home, history, past issues |
| Gives information | Connects to action (pros, products, scheduling) |
| Reactive - you have to ask | Proactive - reaches out with seasonal reminders |
| Generic advice | Localized to your climate, codes, and costs |
| Ends at the answer | Follows through to resolution |

### The Core Differentiators

**1. Home Profile & Memory**
- "My 1985 colonial in Minneapolis with a 12-year-old Carrier furnace"
- Tracks all systems: age, brand, last service, known issues
- Remembers past conversations and fixes
- Gets smarter about YOUR home over time

**2. Local Context**
- Knows your climate zone and seasonal concerns
- Understands local building codes
- Has data on local costs (not national averages)
- Connected to vetted local professionals

**3. Action-Oriented**
- DIY: "Here's how to fix it + here's the exact part on Amazon"
- Pro needed: "Here are 3 plumbers who specialize in this, rated by other Zeke users"
- Emergency: "This is urgent - here's an emergency contact"

**4. Proactive Outreach**
- "It's October in Minnesota - time to winterize your outdoor faucets"
- "Your furnace is 12 years old - average lifespan is 15-20. Let's schedule a tune-up"
- "You mentioned a small roof leak last spring - have you addressed that before winter?"

**5. Continuous Relationship**
- Not a one-off interaction but an ongoing advisor
- Builds trust over time
- Becomes the "first call" for any home question

## Revenue Streams

### 1. Professional Referrals (Primary Revenue)

**The Model:** When AI can't solve it or user wants professional help, connect them to vetted local pros. Charge per lead or percentage of job.

**Market Context:**
- Angi (formerly HomeAdvisor) does $1.5B+ revenue on this model
- Average lead value: $15-50 depending on trade
- Zeke advantage: Higher intent, better qualified leads (AI pre-screens)

**Differentiation from Angi/Thumbtack:**
- AI qualifies the job first (knows exactly what's needed)
- Home profile provides context to pros (they can quote better)
- Relationship continues after job (review, follow-up, future work)

### 2. Product Affiliate Revenue

**The Model:** Recommend specific products for DIY fixes, earn affiliate commission.

**Examples:**
- "You need a 1.5" P-trap. Here's the one I recommend" → Amazon/Home Depot link
- "For ice dams, I recommend these heat cables" → Affiliate link
- Seasonal product bundles: "Winter prep kit for your home"

**Revenue Potential:**
- Amazon affiliate: 1-4% commission
- Home Depot/Lowe's affiliate programs
- Direct partnerships with brands (higher margins)
- Could be $10-50 per monetized user per year

### 3. Insurance Partnerships (B2B2C)

**The Insight:** Insurance companies HATE claims. Water damage alone costs insurers $13B/year. Preventative maintenance = fewer claims.

**The Model:**
- Insurers pay to provide Zeke to policyholders as a benefit
- OR Zeke is bundled, insurers offer premium discounts for active users
- OR Revenue share on prevented claims (harder to attribute)

**Value to Insurers:**
- Reduce claims through preventative maintenance
- Early warning on issues (Zeke knows about problems before claims)
- Policyholder engagement and retention
- Data on home condition and maintenance habits

**Potential Partners:**
- State Farm, Allstate, Liberty Mutual, USAA
- Home warranty companies (American Home Shield, etc.)
- Could be $2-5 per policyholder per year from insurer

### 4. Real Estate Transaction Integration

**The Opportunity:** Home buying is a moment of maximum anxiety and questions. Buyers have hundreds of questions about their new home.

**Use Cases:**

*For Buyers:*
- Pre-purchase: "What questions should I ask about this 1970s home?"
- Post-inspection: Understand inspection report, prioritize issues
- Move-in: "I just bought a house - what do I need to do?"
- Ongoing: Continuous relationship as new homeowner

*For Sellers:*
- Disclosure assistance: "What should I disclose about my HVAC?"
- Pre-listing prep: "What should I fix before selling?"

*For Transaction:**
- Home inspection integration (see Pro tier below)
- Title company partnership (given at closing)
- Real estate agent gifting ("Here's Zeke for your new home")

**Revenue Model:**
- Closing gift paid by agent/title company: $25-50 one-time
- Leads back to agents for future transactions
- Home warranty upsell at closing

### 5. Pro/Business Tiers

**Home Inspector Pro:**
- AI-assisted report generation
