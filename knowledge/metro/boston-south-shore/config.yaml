# Cost Adjustments
cost_adjustments:
  base_multiplier: 1.32  # 32% above national average

# Local Considerations (for AI context)
special_considerations:
  - "Colonials and capes dominate housing stock - ice dams are the #1 winter issue"
  - "Coastal salt air accelerates exterior deterioration - recommend marine-grade materials"
  - "Many homes still have oil heat - oil tank condition is a concern"
  - "Historic districts in Hingham, Cohasset, Duxbury may restrict exterior changes"
  - "Title 5 septic inspections required for home sales"
  - "Carpenter ants are very common - moisture control is key"
  - "Basement moisture affects majority of older homes - sump pumps essential"
  - "High property values mean homeowners invest in quality - price sensitivity moderate"
  - "Nor'easters can knock out power for days - backup heat/generator valuable"
  - "Mass Save rebates available for energy efficiency upgrades"
