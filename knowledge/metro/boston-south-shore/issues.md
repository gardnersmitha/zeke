## Top 10 Issues by Frequency

### 1. Ice Dams (VERY COMMON - Winter)

**Prevalence:** Affects 40-50% of South Shore homes during severe winters

**Why It Happens:**
- Heat escapes from living space into attic
- Snow melts on warm roof areas, refreezes at cold eaves
- Water backs up under shingles and into home

**South Shore Specifics:**
- Colonial and cape homes are most vulnerable due to complex rooflines
- Pre-1990 homes often lack adequate attic insulation
- Balloon framing in pre-1950 homes creates warm air pathways
- Knee wall attics in capes are particularly problematic
- Coastal temperature swings accelerate melt-freeze cycles

**Signs of Ice Dams:**
- Icicles hanging from eaves
- Ice ridges along roof edge
- Water stains on ceilings or walls (upper floors)
- Peeling paint in attic or upper rooms

**Solutions:**
- Immediate: Calcium chloride in pantyhose to melt channels ($20-50 DIY)
- Short-term: Heat cables in problem areas ($200-500)
- Long-term: Attic air sealing and insulation upgrade ($1,500-5,500)
- When reroofing: Extended ice and water shield ($500-1,500 extra)

**Typical Damage Costs:** $3,000-15,000+ if water enters home

### 2. Frozen Pipes (COMMON - Winter)

**Prevalence:** 15-25% of homes experience at least once over 10 years

**High-Risk Locations:**
- Pipes in exterior walls (common in colonials, especially bathrooms on exterior walls)
- Unheated crawl spaces and garages
- Pipes near sill plates and rim joists
- Outdoor faucets and hose bibs
- Supply lines to kitchen sinks on exterior walls

**South Shore Specifics:**
- Many colonials have bathrooms on exterior walls with vulnerable supply lines
- Older homes have minimal pipe insulation
- Seasonal/vacation homes at higher risk when unoccupied
- Coastal areas may have less severe cold but more wind chill penetration

**Warning Signs:**
- No water or reduced flow from faucet
- Frost visible on exposed pipes
- Unusual sounds when running water
- Bulging or cracked pipe visible

**Prevention:**
- Insulate exposed pipes ($50-200 DIY)
- Install pipe heating cable in problem areas ($100-300)
- Open cabinet doors during cold snaps
- Maintain 55F minimum temperature, even when away
- Know water shutoff location

**Typical Damage Costs:** $1,000-10,000+ including water damage

### 3. Basement Moisture and Water Intrusion (VERY COMMON)

**Prevalence:** 60-70% of older South Shore homes have some moisture issues

**Causes:**
- High water table (especially coastal areas)
- Clay soils common in South Shore that hold water
- Poor grading directing water toward foundation
- Failed or inadequate foundation drainage
- Clogged or missing gutters
- Cracks in foundation walls
- Hydrostatic pressure during snowmelt and heavy rain

**Seasonal Patterns:**
- Spring: Snowmelt causes water table rise
- Fall: Heavy rain events and nor'easters
- Year-round: High humidity (basement should be dehumidified)

**Signs:**
- Musty odors
- Efflorescence (white mineral deposits) on walls
- Damp or wet floors after rain
- Mold or mildew growth
- Peeling paint on basement walls
- Rust on metal in basement

**Solutions by Severity:**

| Severity | Solution | Cost |
|----------|----------|------|
| Minor humidity | Dehumidifier | $300-500 |
| Poor grading | Regrade and extend downspouts | $500-2,000 |
| Cracks | Epoxy injection | $400-1,200 per crack |
| Moderate | Interior French drain + sump pump | $5,000-12,000 |
| Severe | Exterior waterproofing | $15,000-35,000 |
