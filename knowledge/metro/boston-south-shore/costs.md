## Overview

The South Shore has significantly higher labor and material costs than the national average. Proximity to Boston drives wages up, and the concentration of older homes requiring specialized skills (historic preservation, older systems) further elevates prices. Coastal properties may incur 10-20% premiums for salt-resistant materials and additional expertise.

### Cost Index vs. National Average

| Category | South Shore | National | Difference |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Overall Cost of Living | 132 | 100 | +32% |
| Housing Costs | 172 | 100 | +72% |
| Trade Labor (hourly) | 140 | 100 | +40% |
| Materials | 115 | 100 | +15% |
