| Cooling Degree Days (CDD) | 650-750 | 1,200 | 42% below national avg |
| Annual Snowfall | 48-55 inches | 28 inches | Higher near coast due to ocean-effect |
| Annual Rainfall | 47-50 inches | 38 inches | Distributed throughout year |
| Humidity Class | Humid | - | Summer relative humidity 65-80% |

| Winter (Dec-Feb) | 38F | 22F | 72F | -12F |
| Spring (Mar-May) | 54F | 38F | 94F | 8F |
| Summer (Jun-Aug) | 79F | 63F | 104F | 45F |
| Fall (Sep-Nov) | 60F | 43F | 96F | 10F |

## Freeze Dates

**First Fall Freeze:** October 15-25 (average October 20)
**Last Spring Freeze:** April 15-25 (average April 20)
**Growing Season:** 175-185 days

### Freeze Risk by Month

| Month | Freeze Risk | Pipe Freeze Risk | Recommended Actions |
|-------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| November | Moderate | Low-Moderate | Winterize outdoor faucets |
| December | High | Moderate | Insulate exposed pipes |
| January | Very High | High | Monitor unheated spaces |
| February | Very High | High | Keep cabinet doors open during cold snaps |
| March | High | Moderate | Do not de-winterize yet |
| April | Moderate | Low | Safe to reconnect outdoor faucets after April 20 |

## Special Climate Risks

### 1. Ice Dams (HIGH RISK)

**Risk Level:** HIGH - One of the most common and costly winter issues on the South Shore

**Why South Shore is Vulnerable:**
- High snowfall combined with freeze-thaw cycles
- Abundance of older colonial and cape-style homes with complex rooflines
- Coastal temperature swings can cause mid-winter melting
- Many homes have inadequate attic insulation (pre-1990 construction)

**Peak Season:** January-February
**Trigger Conditions:** 6+ inches of snow followed by temperatures in the 30s-40s

**Prevention Requirements:**
- R-49 to R-60 attic insulation
- Proper attic ventilation (1 sq ft per 150 sq ft attic floor)
- Air sealing of attic penetrations
- Ice and water shield on roof (code requires 24 inches minimum)

---

### 2. Nor'easters (HIGH RISK)

**Risk Level:** HIGH - 3-5 significant nor'easters annually

**Characteristics:**
- Heavy snow (12-24+ inches possible in single storm)
- Strong winds (40-60 mph gusts, 70+ mph possible)
- Storm surge and coastal flooding
- Extended power outages (12-72 hours)

**Peak Season:** November-April (most severe January-March)

**Home Impacts:**
- Roof damage from wind and snow load
- Power outages affecting heating systems
- Coastal flooding (especially Hull, Scituate, Marshfield oceanfront)
- Fallen trees and debris

**Preparation Requirements:**
- Backup heat source or generator for heating
- Trees trimmed away from power lines and structures
- Emergency supplies for 72+ hours
- Know flood evacuation routes if in flood zone

---

### 3. Coastal Salt Damage (MODERATE-HIGH RISK)

**Risk Level:** MODERATE (inland) to HIGH (within 1/2 mile of ocean)

**Affected Materials:**
- Metal fixtures, railings, hinges, fasteners
- HVAC condenser coils
- Vinyl siding and trim
- Painted surfaces
- Concrete and masonry

**Accelerated Deterioration:**
- Metal components may corrode 2-3x faster than inland
- Exterior caulk and sealants fail 30-50% sooner
- Roof flashings require more frequent inspection
- HVAC condensers may need coil cleaning annually

**Mitigation:**
- Use marine-grade or stainless steel fasteners
- Apply corrosion inhibitor to metal fixtures
- Rinse exterior metal after storms
- Schedule more frequent HVAC maintenance
- Consider impact-rated windows for oceanfront properties

---

### 4. Frozen Pipes (MODERATE-HIGH RISK)

**Risk Level:** MODERATE to HIGH during cold snaps below 15F

**High-Risk Locations in South Shore Homes:**
- Pipes in exterior walls (common in colonials)
- Unheated crawl spaces and basements
- Pipes near sill plates
- Outdoor faucets and hose bibs
- Pipes in attached garages

**Critical Temperature Thresholds:**
- Below 32F: Monitor exposed pipes
- Below 20F: Open cabinet doors, let faucets drip
- Below 10F: High risk - consider heat tape, keep heat at 55F+ minimum

**Cold Snap Frequency:** 5-10 days annually below 15F; 1-3 days below 0F

---

### 5. Basement Moisture and Flooding (MODERATE RISK)

**Risk Level:** MODERATE - Elevated for coastal and low-lying properties

**Contributing Factors:**
- High water table (especially near coast)
- Clay soils common in South Shore
- Spring snowmelt
- Coastal storm surge (flood zones)
- Older homes with poor foundation drainage

**Seasonal Patterns:**
- March-April: Snowmelt increases groundwater
- Fall: Nor'easter and rain events
- Year-round: High humidity requires dehumidification

**Mitigation Requirements:**
- Sump pump with battery backup
- Proper grading away from foundation
- Gutter maintenance and downspout extensions
- Dehumidifier for basements (target 50% RH)
- Consider interior drain tile for chronic issues

---

### 6. Hurricane/Tropical Storm Risk (LOW-MODERATE)

**Risk Level:** LOW to MODERATE - Direct hits rare but do occur

**Historical Events:**
- Hurricane Bob (1991) - significant South Shore damage
- Hurricane Sandy (2012) - coastal flooding
- Tropical Storm Irene (2011) - flooding

**Primary Threats:**
- Storm surge (oceanfront and harbor properties)
- Wind damage to roofs and trees
- Extended power outages
- Coastal erosion

**Season:** June 1 - November 30 (peak August-September)

## Seasonal Maintenance Triggers

### Winter (December-February)
- Monitor for ice dams after every significant snowfall
- Check attic for frost accumulation
- Ensure heating system runs efficiently
- Keep snow cleared from dryer and furnace vents
- Monitor basement for moisture after thaws

### Spring (March-May)
- Inspect roof for winter damage after snow melts
- Check gutters and downspouts for ice damage
- Look for foundation cracks from freeze-thaw
- Service AC before first use
- Treat for carpenter ants (emerge in spring)

### Summer (June-August)
- Run dehumidifier in basement (target 50% RH)
- Monitor for condensation on windows (humidity indicator)
- Trim vegetation away from foundation
- Clean AC condenser coils (especially coastal homes)
- Inspect deck and exterior wood for moisture damage

### Fall (September-November)
- Clean gutters before leaf fall and after
- Winterize outdoor faucets and sprinkler systems
- Service heating system
- Inspect weatherstripping and caulking
- Prepare for nor'easter season

## Climate-Specific Building Recommendations

### For South Shore New Construction or Major Renovation:

**Insulation:**
- Attic: R-60 (above code minimum)
- Walls: R-21 to R-30
- Foundation: R-15 minimum

**Roofing:**
- Ice and water shield: 6 feet up from eave (code is 24 inches)
- Metal drip edge
- Proper ridge and soffit ventilation
- Consider impact-rated shingles for coastal exposure

**Windows:**
- U-factor: 0.30 or lower
- SHGC: 0.25-0.40 (balance heat gain/loss)
- Consider triple-pane for north-facing
- Impact-rated for oceanfront

**HVAC:**
- Size for 0F design temperature
- High-efficiency condensing furnace or heat pump
- Whole-house dehumidification recommended
- Backup heat source strongly recommended

**Moisture Management:**
- Sump pump with battery backup
- Foundation drainage system
- Vapor barriers in crawl spaces
- ERV or HRV for air quality
