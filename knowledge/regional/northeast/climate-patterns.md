## Major Weather Threats

### 1. Nor'easters

**Frequency:** 3-5 significant nor'easters annually (more in some years)

**Season:** October through April, most severe January-March

**Characteristics:**
- Heavy precipitation (12-24+ inches snow possible)
- Strong winds (40-60 mph sustained, 70+ gusts)
- Coastal flooding and storm surge
- Extended duration (24-48 hours)
- Can cause "bomb cyclone" rapid intensification

**Home Impacts:**
- Roof damage (wind, snow load)
- Power outages (12-72+ hours possible)
- Coastal flooding (oceanfront properties)
- Fallen trees
- Ice dam formation (after snow)

**Preparation:**
- Backup heat source essential
- Generator recommended for extended outages
- Trees trimmed away from power lines
- Emergency supplies for 72+ hours
- Know flood evacuation routes if coastal

### 2. Ice Storms

**Description:** Precipitation that falls as rain but freezes on contact with cold surfaces, creating ice accumulation on trees, power lines, and structures.

**Frequency:** 1-3 significant events per year

**Season:** December through March

**Characteristics:**
- Ice accumulation 1/4 inch to 1+ inch
- Extremely dangerous travel conditions
- Tree and limb damage
- Power line damage
- Can affect large geographic areas

**Home Impacts:**
- Extended power outages (days to weeks possible)
- Tree and branch damage
- Gutter and roof ice damage
- Heating system failure without power

**Preparation:**

- Trim branches near power lines
- Generator or alternate heat plan
- Ice melt and sand supplies

### 3. Extreme Cold Events

**Description:** Periods when temperatures drop significantly below normal, often with wind chill making it feel much colder.

**Frequency:** 2-5 multi-day events per winter

**Threshold:** Generally defined as temperatures below 10F or wind chills below -10F

**Home Impacts:**
- Frozen pipes (primary concern)
- Heating system strain
- Higher energy bills
- Risk of heating failure at worst time

**Preparation:**
- Insulate exposed pipes
- Know pipe-freezing protocols (dripping faucets, open cabinets)
- Maintain 55F minimum, even when away
- Have heating system serviced pre-season

### 4. Heavy Snow Events

**Description:** Snowstorms depositing 8+ inches, sometimes 18-30+ inches in major events.

**Frequency:** 4-8 events per winter exceeding 6 inches

**Characteristics:**
- Can fall at rates of 2-3 inches per hour
- Wind can create significant drifting
- Wet, heavy snow (nor'easters) vs. light, fluffy snow (cold storms)

**Home Impacts:**
- Roof snow load concerns
- Blocked dryer and furnace vents
- Ice dams after snow
- Access/mobility issues

**Preparation:**
- Know roof load limits
- Have professional snow removal contacts
- Keep vents clear
- Monitor for ice dam formation

### 5. Tropical Systems (Hurricanes/Tropical Storms)

**Description:** Although the Northeast is not a primary hurricane target, tropical systems do occasionally impact the region, sometimes with significant effects.

**Frequency:** Direct impact every 5-10 years; tropical storm remnants 1-2 times per year

**Season:** June through November, peak August-September

## Building Recommendations for Zone 5A Northeast

### Insulation

| Component | Minimum (Code) | Recommended | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| Attic | R-49 | R-60 | Higher is cost-effective |
| Walls | R-20 | R-25+ | Continuous insulation helps |
| Foundation | R-15 | R-20 | Critical for comfort |
| Basement slab | R-10 edge | R-10 full | For finished basements |

### Windows

| Specification | Minimum | Recommended |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| U-factor | 0.30 | 0.25 or lower |
| SHGC | 0.40 | 0.25-0.35 |
| Type | Double-pane, Low-E | Triple-pane for north-facing |

### Roofing

**Ice Dam Prevention:**
- Ice and water shield: 3-6 feet from eave (code minimum is 24 inches)
- Proper attic ventilation: 1:150 ratio minimum
- Air sealing between living space and attic

**Wind Resistance:**
- Class F or G wind rating shingles for coastal
- Consider impact-rated for severe exposure
- 6-nail pattern in high-wind zones

### HVAC Sizing

**Heating:**
- Design for 0F outdoor temperature (Zone 5A)
- Design for -10F (Zone 6A)
- Right-size - oversized systems cycle inefficiently

**Cooling:**
- Design for 85-90F outdoor temperature
- Size for humidity control, not just temperature
- Consider whole-house dehumidification

**Recommendations:**
- High-efficiency condensing furnace (95%+ AFUE) or heat pump
- Heat pump with cold-climate rating (works to -15F)
- Variable-speed systems for efficiency
- Backup heat source recommended (gas fireplace, wood stove, generator)

### Moisture Management

**Basement:**
- Sump pump with battery backup (essential)
- Interior or exterior drainage system for problem basements
- Dehumidifier (target 50% RH)
- Vapor barrier in crawl spaces

**Walls:**
- Proper vapor barrier placement (warm-in-winter side)
- Rainscreen gap for siding in coastal areas
- Housewrap/air barrier

### Air Sealing

**Critical Areas:**
- Attic penetrations (electrical, plumbing, chimney)
- Rim joist / band joist
- Windows and doors
- Recessed lights (IC-rated)
- Attic hatch or pull-down stairs

**Target:** 3 ACH50 or better for new construction
