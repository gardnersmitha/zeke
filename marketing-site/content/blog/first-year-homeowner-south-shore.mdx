# First-Year Homeowner Guide: South Shore Edition

*What to do in your first 30, 60, and 90 days of homeownership in Hingham, Cohasset, Scituate, and the South Shore*

Congratulations on your new home. Whether you have purchased a historic colonial in Hingham, a charming cape in Cohasset, or a waterfront property in Hull, you are now part of the South Shore community. The first year of homeownership comes with a steep learning curve, but it does not have to be overwhelming.

This guide walks you through exactly what to do and when, helping you get to know your home, protect your investment, and settle in with confidence.

## Your First 30 Days: Meet Your Home

The first month is about discovery. You are learning how your home works, where everything is, and what needs attention.

### Day 1-3: Critical First Steps

**Secure Your Home**

- [ ] Change all exterior door locks or have them re-keyed
- [ ] Change garage door opener codes
- [ ] Update alarm system codes if applicable
- [ ] Check that all windows lock properly

**Locate Your Shutoffs**

This is the single most important task for any new homeowner. Water damage is among the most expensive repairs, and knowing how to stop a leak quickly can save thousands.

- [ ] **Main water shutoff:** In South Shore homes, this is typically in the basement near the front foundation wall, close to where the main enters from the street. It will be a gate valve (round handle) or ball valve (lever handle). Test it to make sure it works.

- [ ] **Gas shutoff:** Usually at the meter, which may be outside or in the basement. You will need a wrench to turn it. Consider keeping one nearby.

- [ ] **Electrical main breaker:** In your electrical panel, typically in the basement, garage, or a utility closet. Know which breaker controls which circuits.

- [ ] **Hot water heater shutoff:** There should be a valve on the cold water inlet pipe.

**Document Everything**

- [ ] Take photos of all utility meter readings
- [ ] Photograph the inside of your electrical panel with the cover off (shows which circuits exist)
- [ ] Note model numbers and ages of major appliances and systems
- [ ] Create a folder for home documents: deed, inspection report, warranties, manuals

### Day 4-14: Get to Know Your Systems

**Heating and Cooling**

- [ ] Locate your furnace or boiler and learn how to change the filter
- [ ] Find your thermostat manual (or download it) and learn the programming
- [ ] If you have baseboard heat, learn how to bleed the radiators
- [ ] Locate your AC condenser outside and clear any debris around it

**Plumbing**

- [ ] Locate all toilets' individual shutoff valves
- [ ] Find shutoffs under each sink
- [ ] Learn where your septic tank is (if applicable) or where the sewer line exits
- [ ] Check water pressure and water heater temperature (should be 120 degrees Fahrenheit)

**Electrical**

- [ ] Map your circuit breaker panel (which breaker controls which outlets/rooms)
- [ ] Note the amperage of your main panel (100 or 200 amp is typical)
- [ ] Locate GFCI outlets (bathrooms, kitchen, outdoors) and test them
- [ ] Check that outdoor outlets work

*South Shore note:* Many older colonials and capes on the South Shore still have 100-amp service. This is adequate for most homes but may need upgrading if you plan to add an EV charger, central AC, or other high-draw items.

### Day 15-30: First Maintenance Tasks

**Interior**

- [ ] Replace all HVAC filters
- [ ] Test all smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors
- [ ] Replace detector batteries (even if they seem fine)
- [ ] Check fire extinguisher(s) or purchase if none exist
- [ ] Inspect caulking around tubs, showers, and sinks

**Exterior**

- [ ] Walk the perimeter and note any issues with siding, foundation, or drainage
- [ ] Check gutters and downspouts
- [ ] Test outdoor faucets for leaks
- [ ] Locate property pins or markers (check your survey)
- [ ] Introduce yourself to neighbors

## Your Second Month (Days 31-60): Dig Deeper

Now that you know the basics, it is time to address any issues and establish good habits.

### Schedule Professional Assessments

Consider having professionals evaluate key systems, especially if your home inspection was limited:

- [ ] **HVAC tune-up:** If the system was not recently serviced, schedule a cleaning and safety check. Expect $100-200.

- [ ] **Chimney inspection:** If you have a fireplace or wood stove, have it inspected before first use. Level 1 inspection is typically $100-250.

- [ ] **Septic inspection:** If you are on septic and it was not pumped before closing, schedule it. Pumping costs $300-500 on the South Shore.

- [ ] **Pest inspection:** Even if one was done at purchase, consider a follow-up, especially for older homes. Carpenter ant and termite damage are common in coastal Massachusetts.

### Address Inspection Report Items

Review your home inspection report and create a prioritized list:

**Address Immediately:**
- Safety hazards (faulty wiring, gas leaks, structural issues)
- Water intrusion or active leaks
- Broken locks or security concerns

**Address Within 60 Days:**
- GFCI outlets missing in required locations
- Smoke/CO detectors not up to code
- Minor plumbing leaks
- Weatherization issues (gaps, missing caulk)

**Address Within First Year:**
- Cosmetic issues
- Efficiency improvements
- Upgrades and improvements you want

### Establish Relationships with Local Pros

You will need trusted professionals eventually. Start building your list now:

- [ ] Plumber (for emergencies and routine work)
- [ ] Electrician
- [ ] HVAC technician
- [ ] Handyman for small jobs
- [ ] Snow removal service (essential on the South Shore)

*Local tip:* Ask neighbors for recommendations. South Shore communities are tight-knit, and word of mouth is the best way to find reliable contractors. The Hingham, Cohasset, and Scituate Facebook groups are also good resources.

## Your Third Month (Days 61-90): Settle In and Plan Ahead

By now you should feel comfortable with daily operations. Focus on longer-term planning.

### Create a Maintenance Calendar

Set reminders for recurring tasks:

**Monthly:**
- Check HVAC filter
- Test smoke and CO detectors
- Check for water leaks under sinks

**Quarterly:**
- Change HVAC filter (or as needed)
- Flush water heater (drain a few gallons)
- Check fire extinguisher
- Inspect exterior for damage

**Seasonally:**
- Spring: HVAC tune-up, check roof for winter damage, clean gutters
- Summer: Check AC, inspect deck/patio, pest control
- Fall: Furnace tune-up, winterize outdoor faucets, clean gutters again
- Winter: Monitor for ice dams, check pipes in cold snaps

### Understand Your Insurance

- [ ] Review your homeowner's policy in detail
- [ ] Understand what is covered and what is not (flood and earthquake are usually separate)
- [ ] Know your deductibles
- [ ] Document valuable items with photos and receipts
- [ ] Consider flood insurance if in a coastal flood zone (many South Shore properties are)

### Start a Home Improvement Fund

Financial experts recommend setting aside 1-3% of your home's value annually for maintenance and repairs. For a typical South Shore home valued at $800,000-1,500,000, that is $8,000-45,000 per year.

This sounds like a lot, but major systems do fail:
- New roof: $15,000-35,000
- New furnace/boiler: $5,000-15,000
- New water heater: $1,500-3,000
- Foundation work: $5,000-20,000+

Having a reserve means these expenses do not become emergencies.

## Local Resources for South Shore Homeowners

### Utilities

- **Electric:** Eversource (most of South Shore)
- **Gas:** National Grid
- **Water:** Town-specific (check with your town hall)
- **Trash/Recycling:** Town-specific; some towns require stickers

### Town Services

Each South Shore town has different services and requirements:

- Transfer station/dump locations and hours
- Leaf and brush pickup schedules
- Snow plowing policies (many towns do not plow private roads)
- Building permit requirements

Visit your town's website or town hall to understand local regulations, especially if you plan any renovations.

### Emergency Contacts

Keep these numbers accessible:

- Police/Fire/Medical: 911
- Your town's non-emergency police line
- Utility emergency lines (gas leak, power outage)
- Poison control: 1-800-222-1222
- Your insurance company's claims line

## Common First-Year Surprises on the South Shore

Based on what homeowners in our area commonly encounter:

**Winter:**
- Ice dams (especially on colonials and capes)
- Frozen pipes in unheated areas
- Heating costs higher than expected in older homes
- The importance of having a snow removal plan

**Summer:**
- Humidity and moisture issues in basements
- Carpenter ants and termites
- Higher cooling costs near the coast
- Lawn care more demanding than expected

**Year-Round:**
- Salt air accelerates exterior maintenance needs
- Property taxes may increase after purchase (check with assessor)
- Older homes always have "one more thing"
- Neighbors are a valuable resource (get to know them)

## The First-Year Homeowner Mindset

Here is what experienced homeowners wish they had known:

1. **You will not fix everything in year one.** Prioritize safety and comfort, then work through the list gradually.

2. **Some problems look worse than they are.** That crack in the basement wall might be cosmetic. That drip might just need a washer. Do not panic.

3. **Some problems look minor but are not.** A small wet spot could indicate a big leak. Musty smells mean moisture issues. Take these seriously.

4. **Documentation saves money.** Keep records of all work done, warranties, and receipts. Future you (or future buyers) will thank you.

5. **Ask for help.** Neighbors, friends, and professionals are all resources. There is no shame in not knowing how something works.

**Your home is unique.** A 1920s colonial in Hingham has different quirks than a 1980s raised ranch in Hanover. The generic advice only goes so far. Ask Zeke about your specific home, your specific systems, and your specific questions. We are here to help you become a confident homeowner, one question at a time.
