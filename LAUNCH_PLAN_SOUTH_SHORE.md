## Market Characteristics

### Real Estate Market (2025 Data)

|--------|-------|--------|
| Median home price (Hingham) | $1.3M - $1.7M | Redfin, local agents |
| Days on market | 18 days | Redfin |
| Homes sold within 30 days | 61% | Rocket Homes |

- Drafty older windows

**Coastal Issues:**
- Salt damage to siding, windows, metal

**Seasonal Maintenance:**
- Spring: Inspect winter damage, AC prep, landscaping
- Summer: Humidity control, pest prevention, outdoor maintenance
- Fall: Winterization, gutter cleaning, heating system check
- Winter: Pipe protection, ice dam prevention, emergency prep

**Content Opportunity:** Hyper-local seasonal maintenance guides rank well and establish authority

## Messaging Templates

### Inspector Cold Outreach (Email)

**Subject:** Quick question about your inspection clients

Hi [Name],

I'm [Your name], a Hingham homeowner building an AI assistant for homeowners called Zeke.

I'm reaching out because I know the pain of post-inspection follow-up - clients calling months later asking "is this normal?" or "what was that thing you said about the furnace?"

Zeke handles those questions AND keeps you connected to your clients for referrals. I'm looking for a few South Shore inspectors to try it free and help shape the product.

Would you have 20 minutes for coffee this week? I'm in Hingham and happy to come to you.

[Your name]

### Agent Closing Gift Pitch

**Subject:** A closing gift that keeps you top-of-mind

Hi [Name],

I'm building an AI homeowner assistant called Zeke - think of it as a knowledgeable friend who answers all those questions your buyers have after closing.

"Where's my water shutoff?" "Is this crack normal?" "When should I service my furnace?"

Agents are using it as a closing gift. Every time your buyer asks Zeke a question, they see "Gifted by [Agent Name]."

I'm offering the first 3 months free to South Shore agents who want to try it.

Interested?

[Your name]
